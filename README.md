# Phorest Ecommerce QA Task – Graham Luby

## Description

This project contains an end-to-end UI test set for Phorest’s Gift Card purchasing flow. The main purchase flow and edge cases have been covered by a full set of manual test scripts, which have been executed with evidence enclosed. Three automated test scripts, written using Javascript and Selenium WebDriver, have been included to cover some of the main purchase flows. 
The demo salon, found at https://gift-cards.phorest.com/salons/demous#, served as the testing environment. 

## Technologies used:
* VSCode IDE
* JavaScript
* Selenium WebDriver
* Microsoft Office tools (i.e., Excel, Word)
* Online disposable email address services (i.e., https://www.guerrillamail.com/, https://temp-mail.org/en/)

## Contents:
* User Stories – These were retroactively written following analysis of the website’s purchase flows, edge cases, data flows (i.e., email functionality) and data field requirements. Their function was to serve as a guide when writing the test scripts.
* Manual Test Scripts.xlsx – The manual test scripts. These are included in an Excel spreadsheet, with one test per page. These were written after the user stories had been written.
* List of Tests Needed.docx – This is some “rough work”, serving as a checklist for functionalities to be covered in the tests. Each functionality is marked with the number (in red) of the test which eventually covered it.
* Phorest Project – Bugs Found.docx – A note listing the bugs found while testing.
* Manual Test Evidence – Evidence taken during execution of each manual test, with one Word document per test executed. Test execution was carried out by taking screenshots of each web page and of each action taken, and of each email inbox and individual email.
